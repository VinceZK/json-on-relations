# JSON-On-Relations

## Applicant 

Vincent Zhang (vincezklee@gmail.com)

## Description

JSON-On-Relations is a RESTful framework for business entity modeling and consuming.
It is much more advanced than existing ORM solutions 
by allowing users to focus on modeling itself, rather than the technique configurations stuff.
 
Usually, we model and store business entities in relational databases. 
However, there seems to be not much good frameworks 
that allow easily modeling and consuming these entities in a RESTful style. 
Especially, I haven't seen any one on the **NodeJS** stack.
Thus, I hope JSON-On-Relations can fill the gap.   

## Statement of alignment with OpenJS Foundation charter and mission

I submit my project to the OpenJS Foundation since I believe this project should be given well awareness and governance. 
It fills an important gap between JavaScript and enterprise applications.
